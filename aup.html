Acceptable Use Policy</br></br>
1.    Personal Responsibility</br>I understand that I will be held responsible for any inappropriate or unlawful actions. Any activities occurring under my account are my responsibility. I will accept personal responsibility for reporting any misuse of the ICT facilities to an appropriate staff member.</br>  
The ICT facilities are provided to support education and research in accordance with the educational goals and objectives of the School. If you become aware of a security problem or any misuse of any facilities, notify an appropriate member of staff at once. Never demonstrate the problem to another user. </br></br>
2.    Security</br>
I will only access the facilities using the account(s) allocated to me, and I will not reveal my password to anyone.</br>
Security on any computer system is a high priority. All use of the system must be under your own account.  If you think someone has obtained your password, change it and contact a member of staff immediately. </br></br>
3.    Acceptable Use</br>
·I will not use the facilities in any way that would disrupt use of the services by others.</br>

I will abide by the generally accepted rules of network etiquette (‘netiqette’). </br>
These rules include, but are not limited to the following: </br>
·        Be polite. Never send or encourage others to send abusive messages. Remember that humour and satire are very often misinterpreted.</br>
·        Use appropriate language. Remember that you are a representative of the school on a global public system. You may be alone with your computer, but what you say and do can be viewed by others. Never swear, use vulgarities or any other inappropriate language. </br>

·        Proof read your message to ensure that it is error free and easy to understand.</br>

·        Respect the rights and beliefs of others.</br>
I understand that online purchase of goods or services is only permitted for users over 18.</br>
I will not use School printers for personal or non-school related printing. </br>
All documents should be carefully checked and previewed before printing.  If multiple copies are required these should be photocopied from the original printout.</br>
